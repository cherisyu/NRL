# NRL
Network Representation Learning   
Tensorflow implemention of deepwalk and non-negative matrix factorization   
[A standard NE/NRL(Network Representation Learningï¼‰training and testing framework](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNE)   


**Deepwalk and NMF**      
Args:   
```
--edgelist: edgelist file, looks like node1 node2 <weight_float, optional>;   
--weighted: treat the graph as weighted; this is an action;   
--directed: treat the graph as directed; this is an action;   
--labelfile: node labels, looks like node_id label_id;   
--embfile: save embedding file here;   
--lr: learning rate, default is 0.01;   
--epochs: training epochs, default is 200;   
--dims: representation dimension;   
--neg_size: neagtive sampling number(only for deepwalk);   
--walk_length: random walk length(only for deepwalk);   
--num_walks: number of walks foe each node(only for deepwalk);   
--clf-retio: the ratio of training data for node classification; the default is 0.5;
```   
**DataSet:**  
[datasets are from here](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNE/tree/master/data)  
Wiki : 2405 nodes, 17981 edges, 17 labels, directed   
Cora : 2708 nodes, 5429 edges, 7 labels, directed   

if you want to test deepwalk in cora dataset:   
```cd deepwalk```   
```
python main.py --edgelist ./data/cora/cora.edgelist --labelfile ./data/cora/cora.labels --embfile ./data/cora/cora.emb --directed
```   

if you want to test nmf in cora dataset:   
```cd NMF```   
```
python main.py --edgelist ./data/cora/cora.edgelist --labelfile ./data/cora/cora.labels --embfile ./data/cora/cora.emb --directed
```
